Music Generation: DuetHLSTM
10-707 Final Project

Jocelyn Huang, Menglan Ji, Daniel Martin

DuetHLSTM is a model that generates two-track, polyphonic music using a hierarchical LSTM.
You can find the training data here: https://salu133445.github.io/lakh-pianoroll-dataset/

To train, run process_data.py on the training data, then run music_gen.py.
This will output a set of samples at every epoch in .npy format, which can be converted to MIDI files using midi.py.
To evaluate using objective metrics, run metrics.py on the .npy samples.
