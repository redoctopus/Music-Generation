Music Generation
10-707 Final Project

Group Members: Daniel Martin, Menglan Ji, Jocelyn Huang

Trying to produce two-track, polyphonic music using a hierarchical LSTM.

Notes:
1. Doesn't get to learn overarching structure. Just tries to riff on prev notes
2. Tendencey to repeat the previous note, because that's right most of the time
3. Don't have a good representation of notes together, they're treated indep.
4. With softmax + binary crossent, does quite well in figuring out chord combos.
5. Tends to harmonize between parts reasonably, too, with sync and note matches.
6. At 30 iterations, learns that it doesn't have to hold notes
7. Harmonizes very well by 30-40 epochs, learns some ascending + descending,
   note alternating, up+down structures (67 in epoch 40).
8. Learns to not have too many odd pauses by 30-40.
9. By 20ish, learns to choose next notes that are connected to prev in some way.
10. 30 iterations seems to have the most variety and still have structure
11. 1st epoch ignores accompaniment and just holds the melody note for the most part.
