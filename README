Music Generation
10-707 Final Project

Group Members: Daniel Martin, Menglan Ji, Jocelyn Huang

Trying to produce two-track, polyphonic music using a GAN.
The architecture involves a hierarchical sequence generator (LSTM), and 
a discriminator that takes in the tracks as well as a few other metrics.


Things to Try (If Time Allows):
  - Varying seq_len for generator
  - Different methods of binarizing generator output
